# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project's example scripts contain Unicode emoji characters that cause encoding errors when run on Windows systems using GBK console encoding. This results in `UnicodeEncodeError` exceptions that prevent the examples from running successfully. The system needs to be updated to handle Unicode characters properly across all platforms while maintaining the visual appeal and functionality of the example scripts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running examples on Windows, I want the scripts to execute without Unicode encoding errors, so that I can test and demonstrate the RAG functionality successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs any example script on Windows THEN the system SHALL handle Unicode characters without throwing UnicodeEncodeError
2. WHEN the console encoding is GBK or other non-UTF8 encoding THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle or replace Unicode characters
3. WHEN Unicode characters cannot be displayed THEN the system SHALL use ASCII alternatives that maintain readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent Unicode handling across all example scripts, so that the codebase maintains uniformity and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any example script contains Unicode characters THEN the system SHALL apply consistent encoding handling
2. WHEN running on different operating systems THEN the system SHALL provide consistent output formatting
3. WHEN Unicode characters are replaced THEN the system SHALL maintain the semantic meaning of the original symbols

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fix to be backwards compatible, so that existing functionality is preserved while adding Unicode support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the encoding fix is applied THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN running on systems that support Unicode THEN the original Unicode characters SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN running on systems that don't support Unicode THEN ASCII alternatives SHALL be used without breaking functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable solution for Unicode handling, so that future scripts can avoid similar encoding issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new example scripts THEN developers SHALL have access to a Unicode handling utility
2. WHEN the utility is used THEN it SHALL automatically detect console encoding capabilities
3. WHEN the utility detects encoding limitations THEN it SHALL provide appropriate character substitutions
